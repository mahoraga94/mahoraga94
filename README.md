# Mahoraga

Hi. I’m **Mahoraga** — a programmer from **India**.  
I build **systems software** because I like being close to the machine, where abstractions are earned, not handed out.

I care about correctness, simplicity, and tools that do one thing well.  
I spend most of my time thinking about compilers, low-level tooling, operating systems, and language design.

I genuinely **love Rust**, and I have a deep appreciation for **Haskell** and **OCaml** for how they force clarity of thought.  
I do not like AI hype. I prefer tools that are understandable, inspectable, and honest.

## Philosophy

I try to live and work by **Stoic principles**.

Stoicism, at its core, is about:
- Focusing only on what you can control  
- Accepting what you cannot  
- Acting with reason, discipline, and compassion  

It teaches calm in chaos, humility in success, and dignity in failure.  
It also teaches something often missed: **to treat all people with fairness and goodwill**, even when the world does not return the favor.

I try to write code the same way — simple, deliberate, and resilient.

## Projects Worth Mentioning

### xasm-rs
An **assembly generator** written in Rust.  
Long-term goal: evolve it into a **compiler backend** with explicit control over codegen.

Repository: https://github.com/mahoraga94/xasm-rs

---

### negma
A **NixOS management tool** that collects commonly used commands into a single, consistent interface.  
Built to reduce friction when working with declarative systems.

Repository: https://github.com/mahoraga94/negma

---

### ruty
A **game engine in Rust**, built using `macroquad`.  
Mostly experimental, partly educational, occasionally fun.

Repository: https://github.com/mahoraga94/ruty

- **Discord**: mahoraga94  

I usually reply pretty fast, but I enjoy conversations about systems, programming languages, philosophy, and why simple things are often the hardest to build.
